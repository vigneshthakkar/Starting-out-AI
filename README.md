# Starting-out-AI
Some of my first works using Artificial Intelligence and machine learning.

AIStack is a program written in python which has a set of stacks which can be altered. There can be 5 stack and each stack can have 5 members each. You can ask the program to put any number over any other. During this process, the program learns how and why it is doing the arrangements that needs to be done. This helps it to answer the questions about the questions asks to it later. The answers are witty too. Cool, I think.

OptimalSearch is a program that can find the shortest path between a starting position and final position in a map. The input is the map details. It uses A* search algorithm.

AIMushrooms would be a great help for mushroom lovers. It is a program which helps to identify weather a mushroom is edible or not...by asking questions about its appearence. Btw, I actually connected this program with the MySQL database in my PC which had the data for identification. The data about the mushrooms was taken from - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom

AIAnimal is somewhat similar to AIMushrooms. It allows you to guess animals and then guesses the animal by asking questions about its traits. Here too, the data was stored in my database which was used to run this. The dataset was downloaded from - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Zoo

IrisClassifier is a simple program that demonstrates how the famous iris flower dataset can be classified using Multiclass Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and Gaussian Naive Bayes Classification Algorithms. This was the result of some of my attemps to learn classification and regression algorithms and exploring Sci-Kit Learn. As usual, the iris dataset was fetched from mysql localhost database.

Simple stuff. Just getting started. Loving it. :)
